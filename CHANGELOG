* Add rain-delta code, since rainin contains some sort of hourly total and not only the rain measured since the last packet.  A sensor_map edit/rebuild may be required to use these new values.  See "Rain Delta Calculations" in the README file for a detailed explanation.

* Added support for dateutc=now in WU packets, to handle stations that do not have on-board clocks and send "now" per the WU protocol.

* Updated TODO to reflect known issue with rain measurements.  Need to add rain-delta code, since rainin contains some sort of hourly total and not only the rain measured since the last packet.  Look for a quick v1.20 in the next day or so.

* Added check to cowardly refuse to start up if sensor_map is missing from weewx.conf.

* Added Ambient Weather URL parsing, in addition to Weather Underground URL posts.
