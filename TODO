* DONE!!!  Need to add rain-delta code, since rainin contains some sort of hourly total and not only the rain measured since the last packet.


2019-02-05:

* Need to implement other packet formats intercepted/forwarded by the Atmocom device, such as per-minute Ambient Weather updates.
  (Note: Ambient Weather packets now parsed as of 2019-02-12.)

* Only tested against one Ambient Weather station model.  Need to get feedback if there are differences between models.

* Need to test against non-Ambient Weather stations utilizing the Atmocom device.


2019-02-16:

* Running "wee_config --reconfigure" with weewx.METRIC or weewx.METRICWX options will build a bogus example
  sensor_map, since as far as I can determine Weather Underground only accepts imperial units.

* DONE!!!  Need to add support for WU option dateutc=now , which lets WU assign the current time for stations without a clock.
